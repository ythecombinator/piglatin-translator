## Overview

Pig Latin is a language game with the following rules:

- Words that start with a consonant have their first letter moved to the end of the word and the letters `ay` added to the end.
  - **Hello** becomes **Ellohay**
- Words that start with a vowel have the letters `way` added to the end.
  - **apple** becomes **appleway**
- Words that end in `way` are not modified.
  - **stairway** stays as **stairway**
- Punctuation must remain in the same relative place from the end of the word.
  - **canâ€™t** becomes **antcaâ€™y**
  - **end.** becomes **endway.**
- Hyphens are treated as two words
  - **this-thing** becomes **histay-hingtay**
- Capitalization must remain in the same place.
  - **Beach** becomes **Eachbay**
  - **McCloud** becomes **CcLoudmay**
